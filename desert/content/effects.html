<p>Desertification, in short, is when land that was of another type of biome turns into a desert biome because of
changes of all sorts. A huge issue that many countries have is the fact that there are large pockets of land
that are going through a process that is known as desertification.</p>

<br>
<p>Another thing Overgrazing is the major cause of desertification worldwide. Other factors that cause desertification
include urbanization, climate change,overuse of groundwater, deforestation, natural disasters, and till age
practices in agriculture that make soils more vulnerable to wind. Desertification affects topsoil, groundwater
reserves, surface runoff, human, animal, and plant populations. Water scarcity in drylands limits the production of
wood, crops, forage, and other services that ecosystems provide to our community.</p>

<br>
<p>According to UNESCO, one-third of world’s land surface is threatened by desertification, and across the world, it
affects the livelihood of millions of people who depend on the benefits of ecosystems that drylands provide.
Desertification is another major environmental concern and a significant barrier to meeting basic human needs in
drylands and is being constantly threatened by increases in human pressures and climatic variability. In this
article, we’re going to give you an idea as to what are the causes of desertification, the effects that
desertification has, and what we can do in order to deal with the problem at hand. Let’s take a closer look at
all of these topics.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Other Main Effects Are:</h1>
<p>Sand and dust storms — There has been a 25% increase in global annual dust emissions between the late nineteenth
century to present day. The increase of desertification has also increased the amount of loose sand and dust that
the wind can pick up ultimately resulting in a storm. For example, dust storms in the Middle East “are becoming
more frequent and intense in recent years” because “long-term reductions in rainfall promot[ing] lower soil
moisture and vegetative cover” and dust storms can contribute to certain respiratory disorders such as pneumonia,
skin irritations, asthma and many more.They can pollute open water, reduce the effectiveness of clean energy
efforts, and halt most forms of transportation.</p>
<p>Dust and sand storms can have a negative effect on the climate which can make desertification worse. Dust particles
in the air scatter incoming radiation from the sun. The dust can provide momentary coverage for the ground
temperature but the atmospherictemperature will increase. This can disform and shorten the life time of clouds
which can result in less rainfall.</p>

<br>
<p>Food security — Global food security is being threatened by desertification and overpopulation. The more the
population grows, the more food that has to be grown. The agricultural business is being displaced from one country
to another. For example, Europe on average imports over 50% of its food. Meanwhile, 44% of agricultural land is
located in dry lands and it supplies 60% of the world’s food production. Desertification is decreasing the amount
of sustainable land for agricultural uses but demands are continuously growing. In the near future,the demands
will overcome the supply.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Vegetation patterning — As the desertification takes place, the landscape may progress through different stages and
continuously transform in appearance. On gradually sloped terrain, desertification can create increasingly larger
empty spaces over a large strip of land, a phenomenon known as “brousse tigrée”. A mathematical model of this
phenomenon proposed by C. Klausmeier attributes this patterning to dynamics in plant-water interaction. One outcome
of this observation suggests an optimal planting strategy for agriculture in arid environments.</p>
